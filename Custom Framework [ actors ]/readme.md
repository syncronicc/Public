# Custom Framework <sup>Uses actors!</sup>

I made this within a hour, works well within my machine. Its a very fast, compact and simple server-only framework.

It does not include client controllers since it ll be used for the stuff I make as a showcase in the future.

Intended for commercial / private usage, just know its not **battle-tested** or **heavy tested**.

This uses actors for the boot module, so when you get a service you actually send a request to the actor and it runs it in parallel for a faster approach.

### Usage

In this folder you can add more services;

Extra note: it does not convert the services into a metatable, so it will remain functional for now, the module is very customizeable ( not the config, the code itself )!
